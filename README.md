Vagrant & Virtualbox
--------------------

For those who aren't already familiar with them, Vagrant "is a tool for
building and distributing virtualized development environments"; whereas,
Virtualbox "is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at
server, desktop and embedded use."
